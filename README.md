Naive Bayes Example
---
As an exercise while reading [Machine Learning, A Probabilistic Perspective](https://smile.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Probabilistic-Perspective-Computation/dp/0262018020/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1528651874&sr=8-2&keywords=machine+learning+a+probabilistic+perspective&dpID=41SbWSolCgL&preST=_SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch) I decided to implement a Naive Bayes classifier. The basic assumption behind a naive bayes classifier is that the features of your classifier are independent of one-another.
# Data
I used the [Auto MPG Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg) to predict the number of cylinders on a vehicle given its horsepower, miles-per-gallon, displacement, weight, and acceleration.
